# Dashboard Upload Button Assessment

## Current Status

The upload functionality appears to be **incomplete** for the following reasons:

1. **Missing Views Directory**:

   - The application tries to render `dashboard.ejs` but there's no views directory present
   - The EJS template containing the upload button is not available in the codebase

2. **Incomplete Upload Implementation**:

   - While there is Multer configuration set up for handling file uploads in `videoRoutes.js`
   - There is no actual route handler implementing the upload endpoint
   - The upload configuration exists but is not being used

3. **Missing Route Connection**:
   - The dashboard route exists in `video.js` but it's not connected to the upload functionality
   - The upload configuration in `videoRoutes.js` is not tied to any route handler

## Required Fixes

To make the upload functionality work properly, the following steps are needed:

1. Create a views directory with the dashboard.ejs template:

```
mkdir views
touch views/dashboard.ejs
```

2. Add proper upload route handler in videoRoutes.js:

```javascript
router.post("/upload", upload.single("video"), (req, res) => {
  // Handle the uploaded file
  res.redirect("/dashboard");
});
```

3. Ensure dashboard.ejs has the correct form structure:

```html
<form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="video" accept="video/*" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

4. Configure Express to use EJS and the views directory in app.js:

```javascript
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.set("views", "./views");
```

Until these components are properly implemented and connected, the upload button in dashboard.ejs will not work as expected.
